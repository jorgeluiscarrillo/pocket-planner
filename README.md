## Motivation
Pocket Planner is an Android application committed to making social events easy to manage and organize. Users can create events, invite friends, message others, and view a list of people attending a specific event. The application uses Google's Maps and Places APIs to provide users with a friendly interface for searching geographical locations and local businesses. This allows event hosts to provide accurate locations for their event and event attendees with an easy way to get directions to their event.

This project was done as a software engineering project at California State University, Long Beach, for CECS-445.

Team: Bryan Duong, Daehee Kang, Jorge Carrillo, and Kun Zheng.
